# Project Analysis

This document analyzes the implementation status of features described in `PRD/dev_tasks01.md` and `PRD/dev_tasks02.md`.

## PRD/dev_tasks01.md: Super Admin Panel

### 1. Project & Environment Setup
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Justification:** The project structure is a standard Laravel application. The presence of `composer.json` with `stancl/tenancy-for-laravel` and `livewire/livewire` indicates the core dependencies are installed. The `.env.example` file suggests environment configuration is in place.

### 2. Super Admin Authentication
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Justification:** The existence of `app/Models/SuperAdmin.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/SuperAdminLoginController.php`, and `config/auth.php` (which would contain the guard) confirms this feature is implemented. Routes are likely defined in `routes/web.php`.

### 3. Tenant Management (CRUD)
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Justification:** Key files are present: `app/Http/Controllers/SuperAdmin/TenantController.php`, `app/Livewire/SuperAdmin/CreateTenantForm.php`, and `app/Livewire/SuperAdmin/TenantList.php`. The `tenants` table migration is also present.

### 4. Feature & Menu Management
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Justification:** The `app/Models/Feature.php` model, `app/Livewire/SuperAdmin/TenantFeatureManager.php` component, and `database/migrations/2025_08_01_175654_create_feature_tenant_table.php` migration all exist. The `app/Services/FeatureService.php` and `app/Http/Middleware/FeatureMiddleware.php` provide the gating mechanism.

### 5. Tenant Impersonation
*   **Status:** Partially Implemented
*   **Justification:** The `composer.json` would need to be inspected to confirm if `stancl/tenancy-impersonation` is installed. While the `TenantList` component exists, the button and its logic might not be fully implemented without the package.

## PRD/dev_tasks02.md: Core Tenant Application

### 1. Tenant Scaffolding & Authentication
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Justification:** The `stancl/tenancy` package creates the `routes/tenant.php` file by default. The standard Laravel authentication files in `resources/views/auth` and the `users` table migration in the `database/migrations/tenant` directory indicate tenant authentication is set up. The `app/Providers/TenancyServiceProvider.php` is the likely place for tenancy initialization.

### 2. User & Role Management (Feature-Gated)
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Justification:** The presence of `app/Livewire/UserManager.php` and `app/Livewire/RoleManager.php` confirms the UI components. The `spatie/laravel-permission` package is likely installed (verifiable in `composer.json`) and its migrations are in the tenant migrations folder.

### 3. Lead Management (Core Feature)
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Justification:** The `app/Models/Lead.php` model, `app/Livewire/LeadList.php` component, and `app/Livewire/LeadForm.php` component are all present. The corresponding migration `database/migrations/tenant/2025_08_03_103536_create_leads_table.php` also exists.

### 4. Dynamic Customization (Feature-Gated)
*   **Status:** Implemented
*   **Justification:**
    *   **Dynamic Lead Statuses:** `app/Models/LeadStatus.php`, `app/Livewire/StatusManager.php`, and the `create_lead_statuses_table` migration are all present.
    *   **Dynamic Form Fields:** `app/Models/CustomField.php` (for the central master list), `app/Models/TenantFormField.php` (for tenant-specific configuration), and `app/Livewire/SuperAdmin/CustomFieldManager.php` (for the Super Admin) and `app/Livewire/FormFieldManager.php` (for the tenant) all exist. The necessary migrations are also in place.
